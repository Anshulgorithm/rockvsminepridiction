# rockvsminepridiction# 🧠 Rock vs Mine Prediction Using Logistic Regression

## 📌 Overview
This repository features a machine learning project that uses **Logistic Regression** to classify sonar signals as either **rock** or **mine**. It’s a focused exploration of binary classification using a classic dataset and foundational ML techniques.

## 📊 Dataset Details
- **Source:** [Sonar Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- **Samples:** 208
- **Features:** 60 numerical values derived from sonar signals
- **Target Classes:** `Rock` and `Mine`

⚠️ The dataset is not re-uploaded here; please refer to the original Kaggle source for access.

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- Python 3.x  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- scikit-learn  

## 🔍 ML Workflow
1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**
2. **Feature Scaling** with `StandardScaler`
3. **Model Training** using Logistic Regression
4. **Evaluation Metrics**
